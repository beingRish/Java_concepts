Generic types allow you to define a class, interface or method with placeholders(type parameters) for the data types they will work with.

T: Type
E: Element(used in collections)
K: Key(used in maps)
V: value(used in maps)
N: Number

            WILDCARDS IN GENERICS
In Java Generics, wildcards (?) are a special kind of type argument that can be used in method arguments or class definitions to represent an unknown type.
They allow for more flexible and dynamic code by letting the type be specified later or be more loosely defined.
