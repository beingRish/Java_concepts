Types of errors:
1. Syntax error
2. Logical error
3. Runtime error

The Exception Handling is a way to handle the runtime errors
so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.
It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
