/*
Poly + morph => many + form
Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming(OOP)
that allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon,
even though the method name and its signature might be the same.

Polymorphism types:
compile time polymorphism - we can achieve compile time polymorphism by method overloading.
run time(Dynamic method dispatch) polymorphism - we can achieve run time polymorphism by method overriding by the help of inheritance.
